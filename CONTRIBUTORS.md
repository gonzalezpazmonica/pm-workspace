## How to get listed

Every contribution counts — not just code. We recognise contributions of all types:

- `code` — new commands, skills, scripts, or bug fixes
- `docs` — improvements to README, SKILL.md files, examples, or translations
- `test` — additions to the test suite or new mock data scenarios
- `ideas` — feature proposals that were accepted and implemented
- `bug` — reported bugs that were confirmed and fixed
- `review` — pull request reviews that improved the quality of merged contributions

When your first PR is merged, a maintainer will add you to this file. If you are not added within a week of your merge, please open an issue with the title `[CONTRIBUTORS] Add <your-name>`.
