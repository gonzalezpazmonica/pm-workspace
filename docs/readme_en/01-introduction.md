# PM-Workspace — Claude Code + Azure DevOps

## What is this?

This workspace turns Claude Code into an **automated Project Manager / Scrum Master** for projects of **any programming language** on Azure DevOps. It supports 16 languages (C#/.NET, TypeScript, Angular, React, Java/Spring, Python, Go, Rust, PHP/Laravel, Swift, Kotlin, Ruby, VB.NET, COBOL, Terraform, Flutter) with specialized conventions, rules, and agents for each. Its most advanced feature is **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**: a process in which technical tasks are documented as executable contracts, and Claude can implement them as a coding agent.

**Sprint management:** burndown tracking, team capacity, board status, KPIs, automatic retrospective and review reports in Excel/PowerPoint.

**PBI decomposition:** Claude analyzes the backlog, breaks each PBI into tasks with hour estimates, detects team workload balance, and proposes assignments using a scoring algorithm (expertise × availability × balance × growth).

**Spec-Driven Development:** tasks become executable specifications. A "developer" can be a human or a Claude agent. Claude can automatically implement handlers, repositories, unit tests, and more in the project's language — following the spec as a contract.

**Infrastructure as Code:** multi-cloud management (Azure, AWS, GCP) with automatic detection of existing resources, creation at the lowest possible tier, and scaling only with human approval.

**Multi-environment:** support for DEV/PRE/PRO (or any custom configuration) with confidential configuration protection — connection strings and secrets never go into the repository.

## EXAMPLE — First five minutes with the workspace

_Scenario: Monday morning. You open Claude Code for the first time from the `pm-workspace/` root._

**You type:**
```
What projects do I have configured and what can I do?
```

**Claude responds:**
```
I have 2 active projects configured:
  • ProjectAlpha  — 6-person team, sprint 2026-04 active
  • ProjectBeta   — 4-person team, fixed price, sprint 2026-04 active

I can help you with:
  Sprint        → /sprint:status, /sprint:plan, /sprint:review, /sprint:retro
  Reports       → /report:hours, /report:executive, /report:capacity
  Backlog       → /pbi:decompose, /pbi:plan-sprint, /pbi:assign
  SDD (agents)  → /spec:generate, /agent:run, /spec:status

Where do you want to start? If it's Monday, I recommend /sprint:status
to see the current sprint state before the Daily standup.
```

**You type:**
```
/sprint:status --project ProjectAlpha
```

**Claude responds:**
```
