## 1. Introduction

### What is PM-Workspace?

PM-Workspace is a .NET project management system using Scrum that turns Claude Code (Anthropic's AI coding tool) into an **automated Project Manager / Scrum Master**. It connects to Azure DevOps and provides 27 commands, 9 specialized skills, and 11 AI subagents covering everything from sprint planning to agent-based code implementation.

### Why adopt it in a consulting firm?

- **Reduces sprint management time** from hours to minutes: burndown, capacity, automatic reports.
- **Generates Excel and PowerPoint reports** ready to deliver to clients with no manual editing.
- **Breaks down PBIs into tasks** with estimates, assignments, and workload scoring — eliminating task refinement meetings.
- **Automatically implements repetitive tasks** (Command Handlers, Repositories, Unit Tests) with AI agents.
- **Includes automated onboarding** for new developers with competency assessment and GDPR compliance.

### What it is NOT

PM-Workspace does not replace the PM or the human team. Architecture decisions, Code Review, client negotiation, and people management remain human responsibilities. AI assists, automates repetitive tasks, and informs — but never decides for you.

> **💡 For management:** Estimated ROI is 60-70% reduction in sprint administrative management time + 40-60% of repetitive technical tasks automated by AI agents, at a monthly cost of $20-200/user depending on the plan chosen.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

### Hardware and software

Each team member using PM-Workspace needs:

| Requirement | Detail | How to verify |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| Operating system | macOS, Linux, or Windows (with WSL2) | Terminal available |
| Node.js | ≥ 18 (for reporting scripts) | `node --version` |
| Python | ≥ 3.10 (for capacity calculator) | `python3 --version` |
| Azure CLI | With `az devops` extension | `az --version` |
| jq | Terminal JSON processor | `jq --version` |
| Git | ≥ 2.30 | `git --version` |
| Claude Code | Anthropic CLI (installed in step 4) | `claude --version` |

### Required access

- Azure DevOps account with access to the firm's organization.
- Azure DevOps PAT (Personal Access Token) with scopes: Work Items (Read & Write), Project and Team (Read), Analytics (Read), Code (Read).
- Anthropic (Claude) account with active subscription (created in step 3).

### Pre-decision: Who uses PM-Workspace?

Not everyone on the team needs PM-Workspace. Recommendation for a consulting firm:

| Role | Needs PM-Workspace? | Recommended plan |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| Project Manager / Scrum Master | **Yes** — primary user | Pro ($20/mo) or Max ($100/mo) |
| Tech Lead | **Yes** — for SDD, specs, and code review | Pro ($20/mo) |
| Senior developers | Optional — to launch agents on specs | Pro ($20/mo) |
| Junior developers | No — they work with Azure DevOps directly | Not needed |
| QA | No — receives assigned tasks in AzDO | Not needed |
| Management / PMO | No — receives reports generated by the PM | Not needed |

---

## 3. Signing Up for Claude

### 3.1 Create an Anthropic account

1. Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and click "Sign Up".
2. Register with a corporate email (recommended for traceability).
3. Verify the email and complete your profile.

### 3.2 Choose a plan

For a consulting firm starting with PM-Workspace, the recommended plan is **Pro ($20/month per user)**. This plan includes full access to Claude Code in the terminal and sufficient limits for sprint management and report generation.

| Plan | Price | Claude Code | Recommended for |
|------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Free | Free | Limited | Initial trial (1-2 days) |
| **Pro** | **$20/mo** | **Yes, full** | **PM and Tech Lead (daily use)** |
| Max 5x | $100/mo | Yes, 5x Pro | PM with multiple projects + intensive SDD |
| Max 20x | $200/mo | Yes, 20x Pro | Massive SDD agent usage |
| Team | $25-150/mo per seat | Yes (Premium) | Teams with centralized billing |
| Enterprise | Custom | Yes | Large consulting firms (>50 users) |

> **💡 Tip:** Start with 1-2 Pro licenses for the PM and Tech Lead. If ROI is positive after 2-3 sprints, scale to the rest of the team or negotiate a Team/Enterprise plan.

### 3.3 Activate the subscription

1. On claude.ai, go to Settings > Subscription.
2. Select the desired plan and enter payment details.
3. Confirm the subscription. Claude Code access is activated immediately.

---

## 4. Installing Claude Code

Claude Code is a terminal tool (CLI) installed on each user's computer. It's the interface through which you interact with PM-Workspace.

### 4.1 Installation

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):**

```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Alternative with npm (if you already have Node.js):**

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### 4.2 Verify the installation

```bash
claude --version
```

Should display the installed version (e.g., `claude-code 1.x.x`).

### 4.3 Authenticate

```bash
claude
```

The first time you run `claude`, it will open your browser to authenticate with your Anthropic account. Follow the on-screen instructions.

### 4.4 Diagnostics

If something fails during installation:

```bash
claude doctor
```

This command checks configuration, dependencies, and authentication.

---

## 5. Downloading and Configuring PM-Workspace

### 5.1 Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gonzalezpazmonica/pm-workspace.git ~/claude
cd ~/claude
```

> **⚠️ Important:** The `~/claude/` directory is both your working directory and the GitHub repository. Always work from this root.

### 5.2 Install script dependencies

```bash
cd scripts/ && npm install && cd ..
```

### 5.3 Verify the installation with the test project

PM-Workspace includes a test project (`sala-reservas`) with mock data that lets you verify everything is correctly configured without connecting to a real Azure DevOps instance:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/test-workspace.sh
./scripts/test-workspace.sh --mock
```

Expected result: **≥ 93/96 tests pass**. The 3 failures are expected (Azure CLI not connected and node_modules if not installed).

### 5.4 Workspace structure

After cloning, you'll find this structure:

| Directory | Contents | Editable |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code entry point (global constants) | Yes |
| `.claude/commands/` | 27 slash commands for PM workflows | Advanced |
| `.claude/skills/` | 9 specialized skills | Advanced |
| `.claude/agents/` | 11 AI subagents | Advanced |
| `.claude/rules/` | Modular rules (Scrum, .NET, Git) | Advanced |
| `projects/` | Project folder (each with its own `CLAUDE.md`) | Yes |
| `scripts/` | Auxiliary scripts (Azure DevOps, reports) | No |
| `docs/` | Methodology documentation | Read-only |
| `output/` | Generated reports (Excel, PPT, logs) | Automatic |

---

## 6. Connecting to Azure DevOps

### 6.1 Create the Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Go to Azure DevOps > User Settings (gear icon) > Personal Access Tokens.
2. Click "New Token".
3. Name: `pm-workspace-cli` (or similar).
4. Expiration: 90 days (renew periodically).
5. Scopes: Work Items (Read & Write), Project and Team (Read), Analytics (Read), Code (Read).
6. Copy the generated token (it cannot be viewed again).

### 6.2 Store the PAT securely

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.azure
echo -n "PASTE_YOUR_PAT_HERE" > $HOME/.azure/devops-pat
chmod 600 $HOME/.azure/devops-pat
```

> **🔒 Security:** The PAT is never hardcoded in any repository file. PM-Workspace always reads it dynamically with `$(cat $HOME/.azure/devops-pat)`.

### 6.3 Configure Azure CLI

```bash
az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/YOUR-ORGANIZATION
export AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT=$(cat $HOME/.azure/devops-pat)
az devops project list --output table
```

If you see your organization's project list, the connection is correct.

### 6.4 Edit global constants

Open `CLAUDE.md` (at the workspace root) and update:

```yaml
AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG_URL = "https://dev.azure.com/YOUR-ORGANIZATION"
```

---

## 7. First Commands: Your First Morning

With everything configured, open Claude Code from the workspace root:

```bash
cd ~/claude && claude
```

### 7.1 Verify Claude knows the workspace

Type in natural language:

```
What projects do I have configured and what can I do?
```

Claude will read `CLAUDE.md` and show you the active projects and available commands.

### 7.2 Sprint status (your most-used command)

```
/sprint:status --project YourProject
```

Shows: sprint burndown, items in progress, WIP alerts, people at 100%, blocked items, and remaining capacity. Ideal for preparing the Daily standup every morning.

### 7.3 Team workload

```
/team:workload --project YourProject
```

Shows a visual map of each team member's workload, with overload alerts and redistribution suggestions.

### 7.4 Hours report

```
/report:hours --project YourProject --sprint 2026-04
```

Generates an Excel with 4 tabs (Summary, By person, By PBI, Agents) ready to deliver to the client or PMO.

### 7.5 KPI dashboard

```
/kpi:dashboard --project YourProject
```

Velocity, cycle time, lead time, bug escape rate, and more — all calculated automatically from real Azure DevOps data.

> **💡 Recommendation:** During the first 2 weeks, use only `/sprint:status`, `/team:workload`, and `/report:hours`. Get comfortable with these 3 commands before moving on to PBI decomposition and SDD.

---

## 8. Incorporating an Existing Project

If your firm already has .NET projects on Azure DevOps, here's how to incorporate them into PM-Workspace:

### 8.1 Create the project structure

```bash
mkdir -p projects/my-project/{sprints,specs/templates,source}
```

### 8.2 Create the project's CLAUDE.md

Create `projects/my-project/CLAUDE.md` with project-specific constants:

```yaml
PROJECT_NAME            = "MyProject"
PROJECT_TEAM            = "MyProject Team"
CURRENT_SPRINT_PATH     = "MyProject\\Sprint 2026-05"
VELOCITY_HISTORICA      = 35
SPRINT_DURATION_DAYS    = 10
FOCUS_FACTOR            = 0.75
```

### 8.3 Document the team

Create `projects/my-project/equipo.md` with team members, their roles, hours/day, and expertise areas. This file is essential for the assignment algorithm to work correctly.

### 8.4 Document business rules

Create `projects/my-project/reglas-negocio.md` with the project's domain rules. Claude will use them when breaking down PBIs and generating specs.

### 8.5 Clone the source code

```bash
cd projects/my-project/source
git clone https://dev.azure.com/YOUR-ORG/MyProject/_git/my-project .
cd ../../..
```

### 8.6 Register the project

- Add an entry in the "Active Projects" table of `CLAUDE.md`.
- If it's a private project (production), add it to `.gitignore`.
- Optionally, add to `CLAUDE.local.md` (git-ignored) for sensitive data.

### 8.7 Verify

```bash
cd ~/claude && claude
```

```
/sprint:status --project MyProject
```

If you see the sprint status with real data, the project is correctly incorporated.

---

## 9. Creating a New Project from Scratch

If you're starting a brand-new project at the firm, PM-Workspace guides you from the beginning.

### 9.1 Create the project in Azure DevOps

1. Go to Azure DevOps > New Project.
2. Name, description, and visibility per the firm's policy.
3. Create the team (Team) with assigned members.
4. Configure the first sprint (iteration) with dates.

### 9.2 Create the structure in PM-Workspace

Follow steps 8.1 through 8.6, adapting the constants to the new project.

### 9.3 Create the first PBIs

Create PBIs in Azure DevOps with clear acceptance criteria. Then use PM-Workspace to prepare the sprint:

```
/pbi:plan-sprint --project NewProject
```

Claude will calculate team capacity, select PBIs that fit the sprint, break them into tasks, and propose assignments.

### 9.4 Product Discovery (optional but recommended)

Before breaking down a PBI, you can use the discovery commands:

```
/pbi:jtbd {id}    ← Generate JTBD (Jobs to be Done)
/pbi:prd {id}     ← Generate PRD (Product Requirements)
```

This ensures the PBI is well-defined before investing time in decomposition and development.

## 10. Onboarding the Development Team

PM-Workspace includes an automated onboarding system that facilitates the incorporation of new developers into the team, complying with Spanish and European GDPR/LOPDGDD regulations.

### 10.1 Onboarding flow

The process has 3 mandatory steps, always in this order:

| Step | Command | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1. GDPR privacy notice | `/team:privacy-notice {name}` | Generates the legal notice so the worker knows what data is collected, its purpose, and their ARCO-POL rights |
| 2. Onboarding guide | `/team:onboarding {name}` | Generates a personalized guide: project context, code tour, conventions, first tasks |
| 3. Competency assessment | `/team:evaluate {name}` | Interactive 26-competency questionnaire (12 .NET + 7 transversal + domain) that updates `equipo.md` |

### 10.2 Practical example: onboarding a new developer

**Scenario:** Laura García joins the ClinicManagement project as Full Stack.

**Step 1 — Generate the GDPR privacy notice**

```
/team:privacy-notice "Laura García" --project ClinicManagement
```

Claude generates the document in `projects/clinic-management/privacy/` with company data already filled in. The PM prints the document, Laura reads it and signs the receipt acknowledgment.

**Step 2 — Generate the onboarding guide**

```
/team:onboarding "Laura García" --project ClinicManagement
```

Claude reads the project's `CLAUDE.md`, `equipo.md`, `reglas-negocio.md`, and the source code, then generates a personalized guide with: project summary, architecture, main modules, code conventions, and suggested first tasks to build momentum.

**Step 3 — Assess competencies**

```
/team:evaluate "Laura García" --project ClinicManagement
```

Claude conducts an interactive questionnaire in groups of 3 questions. It assesses 12 .NET/C# competencies, 7 transversal ones, and the project's domain competencies. Each is rated 1-5 (Shu-Ha-Ri scale: Apprentice → Reference) with verifiable evidence. The result is saved to `equipo.md` to improve future assignments.

> **⚖️ Legal compliance:** The system uses legitimate interest (Art. 6.1.f GDPR) as the legal basis, not consent. The privacy notice is NOT a consent form but a rights communication per GDPR Arts. 13-14 and the LOPDGDD (Organic Law 3/2018). Data is stored with minimization (no personal data beyond name and level) and is protected by `.gitignore`.

---

## 11. Gradual Adoption Roadmap

The recommended adoption is incremental. Don't try to use all features from day one.

| Weeks | Phase | Goal | Key commands |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Connection | Configure PAT, verify connectivity, first `/sprint:status` | `/sprint:status` |
| 3-4 | Basic management | Use `/sprint:status` every morning, `/team:workload`, adjust constants | `/team:workload`, `/report:capacity` |
| 5-6 | Reporting | Generate client reports with real data | `/report:hours`, `/report:executive` |
| 7-8 | SDD pilot | Generate 2-3 specs, test agent with 1 Application Layer task | `/spec:generate`, `/agent:run` |
| 9-10 | Onboarding + scale | Onboard new members, scale SDD to 40%+ | `/team:onboarding`, `/team:evaluate` |

### Success indicators by phase

- **Phase 1-2:** The PM can see the real sprint status without opening Azure DevOps.
- **Phase 3-4:** The PM prepares the Daily in <5 minutes with `/sprint:status`.
- **Phase 5-6:** The hours report is generated in <2 minutes (previously: 30-60 min manual).
- **Phase 7-8:** At least 1 repetitive task implemented by agent without errors.
- **Phase 9-10:** New members onboarded with personalized guide and competency assessment.

## 12. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Probable cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| `claude: command not found` | Claude Code not installed or not in PATH | Reinstall with `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh \| sh` |
| `TF400813: Not authorized` | Invalid or expired PAT | Regenerate PAT in Azure DevOps and save to `$HOME/.azure/devops-pat` |
| `az: command not found` | Azure CLI not installed | Install from https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows |
| Empty sprint results | Sprint not active or wrong name | Verify in AzDO > Project Settings > Iterations that the sprint is active |
| Claude doesn't recognize the project | `CLAUDE.md` not updated | Add project to the "Active Projects" table in `CLAUDE.md` |
| `/sprint:status` shows no data | Incorrect IterationPath in `CLAUDE.md` | Verify `CURRENT_SPRINT_PATH` matches the exact AzDO name (with `\\`) |
| Long context error | Conversation too long | Use `/compact` or `/clear` and reformulate |
| SDD agent fails immediately | Incomplete spec or placeholders | Review with `/spec:review` before `/agent:run` |
| `npm: command not found` | Node.js not installed | Install Node.js ≥ 18 from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
