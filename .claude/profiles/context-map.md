## Agent Rule (role: "Agent")

- **Always load**: identity.md
- **Load if needed**: preferences.md (output_format: yaml/json)
- **Load if project scope**: projects.md
- **Never load**: tone.md, workflow.md, tools.md

Output: Structured YAML/JSON, no narrative, no emojis, no greetings.

---

## Default Rule

If command not listed: load **identity.md** only. When in doubt: **less is more**.
